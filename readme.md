### It is a simple project that gives astrology sign outputs based on  math.random to generate randum numbers.
### here i use javscript.js file in whhic bascially i used a object called **collectiveWisdom** which uses several keys such as *sign*,*adivce* etc.
### using an empty array where we pushes the **random_output** that we have generated from the **collectiveWisdom randomly.
